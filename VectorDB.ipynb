By harnessing the strength of IoT devices to capture\\nreal-time emissions data and blockchain’s unwavering security, we propose a\\nsystem that not only enhances transparency and security but also stream-\\nlines carbon credit trading. Our innovative solution addresses the persistent\\nchallenges of data integrity and trust, providing an ironclad, auditable record\\nof carbon emissions and offsetting endeavors. A real-world application of our\\nsystem is showcased through a solar power plant case study.
